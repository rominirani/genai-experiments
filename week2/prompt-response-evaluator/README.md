This is a Google Sheet Add-on that allow you to invoke the Gemini Flash and Gemini Pro flows that were setup on Cloud Run. You can provide a list of Prompts (A1:A10) and select any of the models (Currently Flash and Gemini only). It will invoke the model and present the responses in the sheet itself.
